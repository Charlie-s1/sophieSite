      <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>
        My practice is led by the things we consume and how they consume us. From worlds set in
        daytime TV, to a media-munching centipedal figure in the midst of a fairground scam. I’m
        interested in the properties of entertainment being means to escape, numb, to find and lose
        yourself. The figures in my work appear as seemingly dimensional as one-liners. However,
        their shallow individuality along with the uniformity of caricature, binds them into a
        larger multifaceted being like that of an algorithmic self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sculptural ‘Stained Glass’, ‘Fairground’ and ‘Diorama’ pieces are put through material
        dramas culminating in shoddy facades and broken illusions. In part my work re-imagines
        entertainment pre-cinema in a half-hearted rejection of modernism despite the themes of my
        work being quite particular to today. Most recently I have developed works that appear as
        stained glass but are actually poured sugar and Isomalt (an engineered sugar). The
        mischievous materiality of sugar and lead is reflective of the addictive, sickly and
        enjoyable qualities of entertainment and media.
      </p>
      <p>
        My figures, in spite of their material facades, perhaps see their own predicament; the
        desire to have more even when they are full and their subsequent deterioration. My work
        critiques the controlling grip of consumerism whilst exploring the tipping willingness of
        the consumer to let it take hold.
